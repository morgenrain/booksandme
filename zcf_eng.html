      <td align=left class=cBody><img src= "images/temp5.jpg" width=226 height=158 border=0 align="right" alt="" hspace=6 vspace=3>Ethnic Chinese are historically a highly migrant people, actively emigrating to adopted countries on one hand, yet maintaining a strong desire for homeland connections on the other.  Modern Chinese immigrants tend to adopt a country after graduate study, and are hence better educated, and sometimes more Westernized than forebears who made their way via labor or trade.  This Westernization leaves new immigrant parents at a disadvantage when attempting to raise a newborn the traditional way in an adopted country.  Overseas Chinese schools help with language and culture education, but focus predominantly on primary school-age children or later; structured support is lacking for new parents to-be through pre-kindergarten age children.  The Zhaoyu Cultural Foundation seeks to support parents and children going through this stage of life through focused integration of global Chinese media and community resources.
